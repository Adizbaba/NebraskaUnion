/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Horizon Financial Banking App
 *
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all user account data.
 *              Each user's account information is stored under their respective Firebase Authentication UID,
 *              ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 *
 * @dataStructure All user data is nested under the `/users/{userId}/account/{accountId}` path,
 *                where `{userId}` and `{accountId}` correspond to the Firebase Authentication UID.
 *                The `UserAccount` document contains personal and account details.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 *   - All write operations require authentication.
 *   - `create` operations enforce that the `userId` and `accountId` in the path match the authenticated user's UID.
 *   - `update` and `delete` operations are restricted to the owner of the account.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization Not applicable in this design, as path-based ownership is sufficient and scalable.
 *                               No denormalization is required because there are no collaborative features.
